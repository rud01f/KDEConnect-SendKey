# KDEConnect-SendKey

Proof-of-concept of making your computer keyboard a remote keyboard for Android phone with KDE Connect installed.

- for those who got excited about KDE Keyboard, just to find out it works only on KDE.

- tested on xUbuntu 18.04 Bionic (XFCE).

Use it as a base for your code if you wish to make one.

- code should run fine under python3 and python3-pyqt4 package installed


Happy using!
